To build, use Visual Studio Code, install the plugin Amiga Assembly.

Find a kick 1.3 ROM and stick it in uae/rom/kick13.rom. 

Use the launchers WinUAE Run to run as executable or WinUAE Run ADF to run from bootblock. Debug bootblock doesn't currently work.

When running from exe there is slightly more code to make it work, so it is a bit bigger than the bootblock bin.
